            %p These are some seriously awesome people and they needed a new brand that would show off not only their capabilities, but their rockstar personalities.

              %h6 Branding
              %p Vision Plastics had made significant investments in their equipment and their brand needed to reflect their business capabilities. Picking classic colors with a fun twist along with a clean, modern typeface gave their name the attention it deserved.

              %p After touring the facility, our team had the same reaction; “this place is so clean”. And our theme for the website was born. Shooting new photos of the facility allowed us to use minimal copy and leverage the new imagery to display the capabilities. Our favorite three C’s: clean, crisp, concise.

              %p This client had an amazing story to tell. Our goal throughout this piece was to capture the innovative knowledge, technologies and capabilities within the company, but more importantly, we wanted to focus on the people of Vision Plastics. It was, after all, the people that made this company unique from the competition and who could genuinely tell the story of their new tagline, “Imagine More.”
              %p It was a thrill to see the excitement on their faces when we showed up on the day of the video shoot with an 8-person crew toting two truckloads worth of video gear. The making-of the video was truly an endeavor built upon teamwork; we were lucky to be working with such an incredible group of people at Vision Plastics. As for the few camera-shy folks, they found other ways to help out behind the scenes (as well as some pretty amazing hiding places) while the camera was rolling.

              %p A little face-lift never hurt anyone, right? In this case, it allowed Vision Plastics to become more competitive in the international and national space. Their new brand not only put a welcoming face to their name, it ultimately gave them the freedom to work with their ideal clients, providing long term successes and building lasting relationships.

                %h6 Branding
                %p As a new company, NerdDeck started with a clean slate. Their brand needed to portray that they were cutting edge, just like their new technology service. Bright colors matched with a sleek logo definitely set them apart from the competition.

                %p The new website needed to quickly and effectively educate viewers on this service. Due to found successes within the video, we leveraged assets to bring continuity to the brand. Creating a hybrid of technology lingo and animated cartoon super heroes allowed consumers to understand this service while the NerdDeck brand appeared approachable.

                %p Have you ever watched a video on a technology service? We know, they can be boring. Our challenge was to educate and inform an audience about a new technology service in a fun way that would capture their attention to the fullest. We met with the client extensively to ensure we were properly deciphering the technical speak. From there we developed a script and storyboards laced with puns to simplify the tech talk and spice up the flavor. Our animator got to work creating adorable characters to act out the bizarre scenarios to engage the viewer while stealthily informing them of the technology our client had to offer.

Upon completion of the quizzes, participants were rewarded with a prize relevant to the campaign theme. The following two phases included a digital trail map with instructions on next steps. Each phase provided the participant to receive a prize, yielding high response rates. This educational campaign provided both knowledge on the new program and increased comfort levels, allowing the sales team to build the pipeline with prospects.

                %p Such props used included a: shake-weight, megaphone, fake blue jay, adult-sized onesie, football player (not to be confused with futbol), golf cart, boxing robe, and to top it off, a speedo. Let’s just say we were fortunate to be working with talent that was far from camera shy and had a good sense of humor.

We assembled a crew of 18+ people and a few extras (including one butt-double for the speedo scene) to take over an exercise facility and create a mock Rocky montage. The new GM-to-be was pummeled with a swarm of tennis balls, tied to golf carts, drenched in water, and through it all he laughed it off and asked for more. Talk about a good sport!
